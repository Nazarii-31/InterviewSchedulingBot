# AI API Alternatives for Scheduling Bot

## Current Implementation
The current implementation uses a custom rule-based ML model (`SchedulingMLModel`) that provides:
- Time slot prediction based on historical patterns
- User preference learning
- Confidence scoring for meeting times
- Conflict probability calculations

## Recommended API Alternatives

### 1. Microsoft Graph API - FindMeetingTimes
**Best integration option** since we're already using Microsoft Graph:

```csharp
// Microsoft Graph already provides intelligent meeting time suggestions
var findMeetingTimes = await graphServiceClient.Me.Calendar.GetSchedule
    .PostAsync(new GetSchedulePostRequestBody
    {
        Schedules = attendeeEmails,
        StartTime = new DateTimeTimeZone { DateTime = startTime.ToString("o"), TimeZone = "UTC" },
        EndTime = new DateTimeTimeZone { DateTime = endTime.ToString("o"), TimeZone = "UTC" }
    });
```

**Advantages:**
- Already integrated in the project
- Native Microsoft 365 calendar integration
- Handles time zone complexities
- No additional API costs
- Built-in conflict detection

**Limitations:**
- Limited ML capabilities for user preference learning
- No custom historical pattern analysis

### 2. Azure AI Services - Anomaly Detector + Custom Vision
**For advanced pattern recognition:**

```csharp
// Use Azure AI for pattern analysis
var client = new AnomalyDetectorClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
var request = new DetectRequest()
{
    Series = historicalSchedulingData.Select(d => new TimeSeriesPoint(d.Timestamp, d.SuccessRate)).ToList(),
    Granularity = TimeGranularity.Daily
};
var response = await client.DetectEntireSeriesAsync(request);
```

**Advantages:**
- Professional ML capabilities
- Time series analysis for scheduling patterns
- Automatic anomaly detection in user behavior
- Scalable and production-ready

**Limitations:**
- Additional Azure costs
- Requires more complex integration
- May be overkill for scheduling use case

### 3. Azure OpenAI Service / ChatGPT API
**For intelligent scheduling decisions:**

```csharp
// Use GPT for intelligent scheduling recommendations
var client = new OpenAIClient(apiKey);
var response = await client.GetCompletionsAsync(
    "gpt-4",
    new CompletionsOptions()
    {
        Prompts = { $"Based on this user's meeting history: {historyJson}, suggest optimal meeting times for {request}" },
        MaxTokens = 150
    });
```

**Advantages:**
- Very intelligent decision making
- Natural language processing for feedback
- Can handle complex scheduling logic
- Continuously improving

**Limitations:**
- API costs can be significant
- Response time variability
- Data privacy considerations
- May require fine-tuning for scheduling domain

### 4. Google Calendar API - Smart Scheduling
**Alternative calendar integration:**

```csharp
// Google Calendar API has built-in smart scheduling
var service = new CalendarService(/* credentials */);
var freebusy = service.Freebusy.Query(new FreeBusyRequest
{
    TimeMin = startTime,
    TimeMax = endTime,
    Items = attendeeEmails.Select(e => new FreeBusyRequestItem { Id = e }).ToList()
});
```

**Advantages:**
- Good integration with Google Workspace
- Built-in conflict detection
- Free tier available

**Limitations:**
- Requires Google Workspace integration
- Limited to Google ecosystem
- Less enterprise-focused than Microsoft Graph

### 5. Third-Party Scheduling APIs

#### Calendly API
```csharp
// Calendly for advanced scheduling logic
var client = new CalendlyClient(apiKey);
var availability = await client.GetAvailabilityAsync(userId, startTime, endTime);
```

#### When2meet API
```csharp
// When2meet for group scheduling optimization
var client = new When2MeetClient();
var optimal = await client.FindOptimalGroupTimeAsync(attendeeAvailability);
```

**Advantages:**
- Specialized for scheduling
- Advanced group scheduling features
- User-friendly interfaces

**Limitations:**
- External dependencies
- Potential integration complexity
- May require user account management

## Recommendation

**For this project, I recommend a hybrid approach:**

1. **Primary:** Use **Microsoft Graph FindMeetingTimes** for core scheduling logic
2. **Secondary:** Keep a simplified version of custom ML for user preference learning
3. **Optional:** Add Azure OpenAI for intelligent feedback processing and recommendations

### Implementation Plan

1. **Replace heavy ML model** with Microsoft Graph's native scheduling capabilities
2. **Keep user preference tracking** with simplified rule-based learning
3. **Add OpenAI integration** for intelligent scheduling recommendations and feedback processing
4. **Maintain historical data** for continuous improvement

This approach provides:
- ✅ Production-ready scheduling with Microsoft Graph
- ✅ Intelligent recommendations with OpenAI
- ✅ Reduced maintenance overhead
- ✅ Better integration with existing Microsoft ecosystem
- ✅ Cost-effective solution

Would you like me to implement this hybrid approach?
