# Weekend Handling Test Guide

## Key Functionality to Test

The bot now has enhanced weekend handling and AI integration:

### 1. Weekend Business Day Logic
- **Friday "tomorrow" should resolve to Monday**
- **Saturday "today" should resolve to Monday** 
- **Sunday "today" should resolve to Monday**
- **Weekend days should be skipped entirely**

### 2. AI Integration Features
- **Natural language parameter extraction**
- **Intelligent slot generation with business day awareness**
- **Consistent date range processing**

### 3. Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Friday Tomorrow Request
**Scenario**: User requests meeting "tomorrow" on a Friday
**Expected**: Bot should interpret "tomorrow" as Monday (next business day)
**Input**: "Can we schedule a meeting tomorrow at 2pm?"
**On Friday**: Should schedule for Monday

#### Test Case 2: Date Range Consistency  
**Scenario**: User requests meeting from Friday to Monday
**Expected**: Should show Friday and Monday slots (skip weekend)
**Input**: "Schedule meeting from this Friday to next Monday"

#### Test Case 3: AI Parameter Extraction
**Scenario**: Complex natural language request
**Expected**: AI extracts correct parameters with business day intelligence
**Input**: "I need a 90-minute session with john@company.com and jane@company.com next week Tuesday afternoon"

### 4. Testing the New Services

The implementation includes:
- `CleanOpenWebUIClient`: AI-powered parameter extraction with weekend logic
- `InterviewSchedulingService`: Business logic with proper business day handling  
- Enhanced bot handler with weekend awareness

### 5. Manual Testing via Web Interface

1. Open: http://localhost:55119
2. Navigate to the bot interface
3. Test the above scenarios
4. Verify console logs show proper weekend date handling

### 6. API Testing

Test the scheduling API directly:
```bash
POST http://localhost:55119/api/scheduling/find-slots
{
  "startDate": "2024-01-26T00:00:00", // Friday
  "endDate": "2024-01-29T00:00:00",   // Monday  
  "durationMinutes": 60,
  "participantEmails": ["test@example.com"]
}
```

Expected: Should generate slots for Friday and Monday only, skipping weekend.

### 7. Console Log Verification

Look for log entries showing:
- "Converting Friday 'tomorrow' to next business day Monday"
- "Skipping weekend day: Saturday/Sunday"
- "Generated X slots with business day intelligence"
- "AI extracted parameters with weekend logic"
